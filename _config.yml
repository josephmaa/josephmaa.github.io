# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  My name is Joseph and I am a researcher at UCSF studying applied computational methods for improving behavioral models of social behavior in the Manoli lab. Currently, I am working on unbiased classification of behaviors by reducing high-dimensional feature sets generated by neural networks.

  I am currently interested in understanding rumor source diffusion in social networks. I am currently a student at Cal State Fullerton (Fall 2022). I am also pursuing a masters degree at Indiana State University studying mathematics.

  In my free time, I am helping to build a community fridge map application for providing low-income immigrants in NYC access to free food.
